disable-in-internet-explorer-11-description=Due to a bug in the Trident rendering engine (used by IE11), when SPA is used for page navigation, media queries will always be applied when only min-width or only max-width queries are specified, even if the page width does not match those queries. This also affects third-party iframes on the page. Disable SPA to work around this issue.
disable-in-internet-explorer-description=In order to work around a bug in the Trident rendering engine (used by IE11) and MSHTML rendering engine (used by Edge), properly rendering the page with SPA currently requires re-downloading all CSS files on all page navigations for all Internet Explorer browsers, which can cause pages to load more slowly with SPA enabled than with SPA disabled.
