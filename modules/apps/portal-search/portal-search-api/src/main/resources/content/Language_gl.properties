default-keyword-query-configuration-name=Default Keyword Query
default-search-result-permission-filter-configuration-name=Default Search Result Permission Filter
disabled-entry-class-names=Disabled Entry Class Names
disabled-entry-class-names-help=Specify the entry class names for which DefaultKeywordQueryContributor will not include the description, userName, and title fields as part of the keyword search query.
exact-match-boost=Exact Match Boost
exact-match-boost-help=Set the boost value to be applied when search terms match a title as an exact phrase.
excluded-entry-class-names=Excluded Entry Class Names
field-name-patterns=Field Name Patterns
include-inherited-permissions=Include Inherited Permission
include-inherited-permissions-help=Set this to true to include a user's inherited roles as part of search permission filtering. A user's inherited roles include all users assigned to a user from their user group and organization memberships.
index-commit-immediately=Index Commit Immediately
index-commit-immediately-help=Set this to true to immediately commit search index write requests. Setting this to true may negatively impact search engine performance as each write request will force the search engine to refresh the index reader and potentially flush transactions to disk. The default behavior of the portal is to commit immediately for individual index operations (e.g. add blog, update blog) but delay commits for bulk operations (e.g. index all users, index all wikis) until all entries have been sent to the search engine. Setting this to false may cause widgets like Asset Publisher to exhibit a delayed response when showing newly added content. For example, users may experience a delay with the default Elasticsearch search engine. See https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/near-real-time.html for more information.

indexing-batch-sizes=Tamaños de lotes de indexación
indexing-batch-sizes-help=The number of documents to index per batch for model types that support batch indexing. Defaults to 10000. For models with large documents, decreasing this value may improve stability when executing a full reindex.

max-expansions-help=Set the number of unique titles that can be matched when search terms match a title as a phrase prefix.
minimum-buffer-availability-percentage=Minimum Buffer Availability Percentage
nonbulk-indexing-override=Nonbulk Indexing Override
nonbulk-indexing-override-help=A value of "true" causes modified entities to always be reindexed one by one. For performance reasons, this setting is generally turned off in production.
permission-filtered-search-result-accurate-count-threshold=Permission Filtered Search Result Accurate Count Threshold
permission-filtered-search-result-accurate-count-threshold-help=If a search query returns search results with a count that is within this threshold, the total count after permission filtering is guaranteed to be accurate.
permission-terms-limit=Permission Terms Limit
permission-terms-limit-help=Set this to limit the number of permission search terms that will be added to the search query. If this limit is exceeded, no permission search terms will be added. Instead, permission checking will fall back to the search permission filter.
