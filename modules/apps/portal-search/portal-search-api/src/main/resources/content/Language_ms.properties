field-name-patterns=Field Name Patterns (Automatic Copy)
include-inherited-permissions=Include Inherited Permission (Automatic Copy)
include-inherited-permissions-help=Set this to true to include a user's inherited roles as part of search permission filtering. A user's inherited roles include all users assigned to a user from their user group and organization memberships. (Automatic Copy)
index-commit-immediately=Index Commit Immediately (Automatic Copy)
index-commit-immediately-help=Set this to true to immediately commit search index write requests. Setting this to true may negatively impact search engine performance as each write request will force the search engine to refresh the index reader and potentially flush transactions to disk. The default behavior of the portal is to commit immediately for individual index operations (e.g. add blog, update blog) but delay commits for bulk operations (e.g. index all users, index all wikis) until all entries have been sent to the search engine. Setting this to false may cause widgets like Asset Publisher to exhibit a delayed response when showing newly added content. For example, users may experience a delay with the default Elasticsearch search engine. See https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/current/near-real-time.html for more information.

indexing-batch-sizes=Indexing Batch Sizes (Automatic Copy)

permission-filtered-search-result-accurate-count-threshold-help=If a search query returns search results with a count that is within this threshold, the total count after permission filtering is guaranteed to be accurate. (Automatic Copy)
permission-terms-limit=Permission Terms Limit (Automatic Copy)
permission-terms-limit-help=Set this to limit the number of permission search terms that will be added to the search query. If this limit is exceeded, no permission search terms will be added. Instead, permission checking will fall back to the search permission filter. (Automatic Copy)
