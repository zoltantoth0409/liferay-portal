additional-configurations=Additional Configurations
additional-configurations-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED mode. Set custom settings for the embedded Elasticsearch node, in YML format (elasticsearch.yml).
additional-index-configurations=Additional Index Configurations
additional-index-configurations-help=Set custom settings for the Liferay index, in JSON (Elasticsearch Create Index API) or YML format.
additional-type-mappings=Additional Type Mappings
additional-type-mappings-help=Set custom mappings for the LiferayDocumentType, in JSON format (Elasticsearch Put Mapping API). This value should be set with new field mappings only. If you set this value with any overlapping mappings for default fields, index creation fails. To replace default mappings entirely, use overrideTypeMappings.
authentication-enabled=Authentication Enabled
authentication-enabled-help=Enable or disable authentication to Elasticsearch with a username and password.
bootstrap-mlockall=Bootstrap Mlockall
bootstrap-mlockall-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED mode. If this is checked, the process address space is locked into RAM, preventing any Elasticsearch memory from being swapped out.
cluster-name=Cluster Name
cluster-name-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED mode. Set the name of the cluster to join.
discovery-zen-ping-unicast-hosts-port=Zen Discovery Unicast Hosts Port
discovery-zen-ping-unicast-hosts-port-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED mode. Provide a range of ports to use when building the discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts value. Multiple Elasticsearch nodes on a range of ports can act as gossip routers at the same computer.
elasticsearch7-configuration-name=Elasticsearch 7
embedded-http-port=Embedded HTTP Port
embedded-http-port-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED mode. Set the HTTP port of the embedded Elasticsearch node that is created when Operation Mode is set to EMBEDDED.
http-cors-allow-origin=HTTP CORS Allow Origin
http-cors-allow-origin-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED mode. Set the origins to allow when HTTP CORS is enabled.
http-cors-configurations=HTTP CORS Configurations
http-cors-configurations-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED mode. Provide custom settings for HTTP CORS, in YML format (elasticsearch.yml).
http-cors-enabled=HTTP CORS Enabled
http-cors-enabled-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED mode. If this is checked, cross-origin resource sharing is enabled, which determines whether a browser on another origin can make requests to Elasticsearch. If disabled, web front-end tools like elasticsearch-head may be unable to connect.
http-ssl-enabled=HTTP SSL Enabled
http-ssl-enabled-help=Enable or disable TLS/SSL. This setting is only applied if Authentication Enabled is checked.
index-name-prefix=Index Name Prefix
index-name-prefix-help=Set the prefix for the search index name. This value should not be changed under normal conditions. If you change this value, you must also reindex the portal and then manually delete the old index using the Elasticsearch administration console.
log-exceptions-only=Log Exceptions Only
log-exceptions-only-help=If this is checked, exceptions from Elasticsearch are caught and logged without being re-thrown.
network-bind-host=Network Bind Host
network-bind-host-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED mode. Specify the network interface(s) a node should bind to in order to listen for incoming requests.
network-host=Network Host
network-host-addresses=Network Host Addresses
network-host-addresses-help=Set the remote HTTP hosts to connect to. This value is required when Operation Mode is set to REMOTE.
network-host-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED mode. Set the hostname or IP address bound to the node, which is used to publish (advertise) the host to other nodes in the cluster. This is a shortcut which sets the bind host and the publish host at the same time.
network-publish-host=Network Publish Host
network-publish-host-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED mode. Set the single interface the node advertises to other nodes in the cluster, so that those nodes can connect to it.
number-of-index-replicas=Number of Index Replicas
number-of-index-replicas-help=Set the number of replicas for each Liferay index. If unset, no replicas are used. Changes to this value take effect after a full reindex.
number-of-index-shards=Number of Index Shards
number-of-index-shards-help=Set the number of shards to use when a Liferay index is created. If unset, a single shard will be used. Changes to this value take effect after a full reindex.
operation-mode=Operation Mode
operation-mode-help=The REMOTE operation mode connects to a remote standalone Elasticsearch cluster. The EMBEDDED operation mode starts Portal with an internal Elasticsearch instance in the same JVM. The EMBEDDED operation mode is unsupported.
override-type-mappings=Override Type Mappings
override-type-mappings-help=Set custom mappings to fully replace the default mappings for the LiferayDocumentType, in JSON format (Elasticsearch Put Mapping API). If you set this value, index creation ignores the default mappings definition and any extension points, using this alternative mappings definition instead. Use this if you need LiferayDocumentType to be created with nonstandard mappings for default fields. If you just need to add new custom mappings without overlapping any defaults, use additionalTypeMappings.
password-help=Set the password for authenticating to Elasticsearch if Authentication Enabled is checked.
rest-client-logger-level=Rest Client Logger Level
rest-client-logger-level-help=Set the logging level for the Elasticsearch REST client.
transport-tcp-port=Transport TCP Port
transport-tcp-port-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED mode. Specify the port to bind for communication between nodes. Accepts a single value or a range (e.g., 9300-9400).
truststore-password=Truststore Password
truststore-password-help=Set the password to the truststore if HTTP SSL Enabled is checked.
truststore-path=Truststore Path
truststore-path-help=Set the path to the truststore file if HTTP SSL Enabled is checked.
truststore-type=Truststore Type
truststore-type-help=Set the truststore type if HTTP SSL Enabled is checked.
username=Username
username-help=Set the username for authenticating to Elasticsearch if Authentication Enabled is checked.
