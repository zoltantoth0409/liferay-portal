override-type-mappings=Override Type Mappings (Automatic Copy)
override-type-mappings-help=Set custom mappings to fully replace the default mappings for the LiferayDocumentType, in JSON format (Elasticsearch Put Mapping API). If you set this value, index creation ignores the default mappings definition and any extension points, using this alternative mappings definition instead. Use this if you need LiferayDocumentType to be created with nonstandard mappings for default fields. If you just need to add new custom mappings without overlapping any defaults, use additionalTypeMappings. (Automatic Copy)
