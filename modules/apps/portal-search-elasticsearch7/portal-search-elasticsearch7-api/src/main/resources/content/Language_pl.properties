http-ssl-enabled=HTTP SSL Enabled
http-ssl-enabled-help=Enable or disable TLS/SSL.
index-name-prefix=Index Name Prefix
index-name-prefix-help=Set the prefix for the search index name. This value should not be changed under normal conditions. If you change this value, you must also reindex the portal and then manually delete the old index using the Elasticsearch administration console.

network-host-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED (Development) mode. Set the hostname or IP address bound to the node, which is used to publish (advertise) the host to other nodes in the cluster. This is a shortcut which sets the bind host and the publish host at the same time. (Automatic Copy)
network-publish-host=Network Publish Host
network-publish-host-help=This configuration only applies to EMBEDDED (Development) mode. Set the single interface the node advertises to other nodes in the cluster, so that those nodes can connect to it. (Automatic Copy)
node-name=Nazwa węzła (Automatic Translation)

operation-mode=Operation Mode
operation-mode-help=This configuration is deprecated. If Production Mode is enabled, this setting will be ignored. The REMOTE (Production) operation mode connects to a remote standalone Elasticsearch cluster, which can also be achieved by enabling Production mode.

override-type-mappings=Override Type Mappings
override-type-mappings-help=Set custom mappings to fully replace the default mappings for the LiferayDocumentType, in JSON format (Elasticsearch Put Mapping API). If you set this value, index creation ignores the default mappings definition and any extension points, using this alternative mappings definition instead. Use this if you need LiferayDocumentType to be created with nonstandard mappings for default fields. If you just need to add new custom mappings without overlapping any defaults, use additionalTypeMappings.
password-help=Set the password for authenticating to Elasticsearch if Authentication Enabled is checked.
production-mode-enabled=Production Mode Enabled (Automatic Copy)
