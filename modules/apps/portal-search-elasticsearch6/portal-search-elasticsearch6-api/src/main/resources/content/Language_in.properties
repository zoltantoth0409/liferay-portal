additional-configurations=Additional Configurations
additional-configurations-help=Custom settings for embedded Elasticsearch, in YML format (elasticsearch.yml).
additional-index-configurations=Additional Index Configurations
additional-index-configurations-help=Custom settings for the Liferay index, in JSON or YML format (Elasticsearch Create Index API).
additional-type-mappings=Additional Type Mappings
additional-type-mappings-help=Custom mappings for the LiferayDocumentType, in JSON format (Elasticsearch Put Mapping API). This value should be set with new field mappings only. If you set this value with any overlapping mappings for default fields, index creation fails. To replace default mappings entirely, use overrideTypeMappings.
bootstrap-mlockall=Bootstrap Mlockall
bootstrap-mlockall-help=If this is checked, the process address space is locked into RAM, preventing any Elasticsearch memory from being swapped out.
client-transport-ignore-cluster-name=Client Transport Ignore Cluster Name
client-transport-ignore-cluster-name-help=If this is checked, the cluster name validation of connected nodes is ignored.
client-transport-nodes-sampler-interval=Client Transport Nodes Sampler Interval
client-transport-nodes-sampler-interval-help=The interval (in seconds) at which the client node samples/pings connected nodes. If unset, the default Elasticsearch client.transport.nodes_sampler_interval is used.
client-transport-ping-timeout=Client Transport Ping Timeout
client-transport-ping-timeout-help=The time (in seconds) the client node waits for a ping response from a node. If unset, the default Elasticsearch client.transport.ping_timeout is used.
client-transport-sniff=Client Transport Sniff
client-transport-sniff-help=If this is checked, cluster sniffing is enabled to dynamically discover available nodes in the cluster.
cluster-name=Cluster Name
cluster-name-help=The name of the cluster to join. The name should match the remote cluster when Operation Mode is set to remote.
discovery-zen-ping-unicast-hosts-port=Zen Discovery Unicast Hosts Port
discovery-zen-ping-unicast-hosts-port-help=Range of ports to use when building the discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts value. Multiple Elasticsearch nodes on a range of ports can act as gossip routers at the same computer.
elasticsearch6-configuration-name=Elasticsearch 6
http-cors-allow-origin=Http CORS Allow Origin
http-cors-allow-origin-help=Origins to allow when HTTP CORS is enabled.
http-cors-configurations=Http CORS Configurations
http-cors-configurations-help=Custom settings for HTTP CORS, in YML format (elasticsearch.yml).
http-cors-enabled=Http CORS Enabled
http-cors-enabled-help=If this is checked, cross-origin resource sharing is enabled, which determines whether a browser on another origin can make requests to Elasticsearch. If disabled, web front-end tools like elasticsearch-head may be unable to connect.
http-enabled=Http Enabled
http-enabled-help=This setting was deprecated and will be removed in a future release. If this is checked, the HTTP layer is enabled. If unchecked, the HTTP layer is disabled on nodes which are not meant to serve REST requests directly.
index-name-prefix=Index Name Prefix
index-name-prefix-help=The prefix for the search index name. This value should not be changed under normal conditions. If you change this value, you must also reindex the portal and then manually delete the old index using the Elasticsearch administration console.
log-exceptions-only=Log Exceptions Only
log-exceptions-only-help=If this is checked, logs exceptions only from Elasticsearch and does not rethrow them.
network-bind-host=Network Bind Host
network-bind-host-help=The network interface(s) a node should bind to in order to listen for incoming requests.
network-host=Network Host
network-host-help=The hostname or IP address binded to the node, which is used to publish (advertise) the host to other nodes in the cluster. This is a shortcut which sets the bind host and the publish host at the same time.
network-publish-host=Network Publish Host
network-publish-host-help=The single interface the node advertises to other nodes in the cluster, so that those nodes can connect to it.
number-of-index-replicas=Number of Index Replicas
number-of-index-replicas-help=The number of replicas for each Liferay index. If unset, no replicas are used. Changes to this value take effect after a full reindex.
number-of-index-shards=Number of Index Shards
number-of-index-shards-help=The number of shards to use when a Liferay index is created. If unset, a single shard will be used. Changes to this value take effect after a full reindex.
operation-mode=Operation Mode
operation-mode-help=The REMOTE operation mode connects to a remote standalone Elasticsearch cluster. The EMBEDDED operation mode starts Portal with an internal Elasticsearch instance in the same JVM. The EMBEDDED operation mode is unsupported.
override-type-mappings=Override Type Mappings
override-type-mappings-help=Override mappings for the entire LiferayDocumentType, in JSON format (Elasticsearch Put Mapping API). If you set this value, index creation ignores the default mappings definition and any extension points, using this alternative mappings definition instead. Use this if you need LiferayDocumentType to be created with nonstandard mappings for default fields. If you just need to add new custom mappings without overlapping any defaults, use additionalTypeMappings.
retry-on-conflict=Retry on Conflict
retry-on-conflict-help=The number of retries if a version conflict occurs because the document was updated between retrieving it and updating it.
transport-addresses=Transport Addresses
transport-addresses-help=The remote node addresses to connect to. This value is required when Operation Mode is set to REMOTE.
transport-tcp-port=Transport TCP Port
transport-tcp-port-help=The port to bind for communication between nodes. Accepts a single value or a range (e.g., 9300-9400).
