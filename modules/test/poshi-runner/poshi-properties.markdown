### liferay.portal.branch

### mobile.device.name
Sets the name of the mobile device.

### output.dir.name

### save.screenshot

### test.assert.javascript.errors
This boolean, when set to true, will log JavaScript errors when using the assertJavaScriptErrors Selenium function.

### test.assert.warning.exceptions
This boolean, when set to true, will fail after a test has run if the test had any Liferay console errors or JavaScript errors.

### test.base.dir.name
Sets the directory path of the Poshi files used for the test project.

### test.batch.group.ignore.regex
Sets a regular expression string of properties that are ignored when grouping test batches together in sequential test runs.

### test.batch.max.group.size
Sets the max number of the group of tests running in a batch.

### test.batch.max.subgroup.size

### test.batch.property.names
Sets the names of properties used to filter out tests in PQL. Must be paired with test.batch.property.values.

### test.batch.property.values
Sets the values of properties used to filter out tests in PQL. Must be paired with test.batch.property.names.

### test.batch.run.type
Sets how groups of tests are organized. Valid values are _sequential_ or _single_. Sequential will group the tests based off of the other test.batch.* properties, allowing for multiple tests to be set in one axis. Single sets one test per axis. The grouping of tests is printed to another properties file which is read by the CI infrastructure.

### test.case.available.property.names
Sets a comma-delimited list of properties can be set for tests within Poshi.

### test.case.required.property.names
Sets a comma-delimited list of properties that must be set for tests within Poshi.

### test.console.log.file.name
Sets the path to a file of a log file to be evaluated. This is generally used more with Liferay Portal testing.

### test.console.shut.down.file.name

### test.dependencies.dir.name

### test.include.dir.names
Sets a comma-delimited list of directory paths that are to be included in the Poshi project files.

### test.name
Sets the name of the test case that will be run. This can be the specific test case command name, or the name of the test case file. Additionally, it can be a comma-delimited list of a combination of both, which will run sequentially. In order to actually take advantage of this though, the tests themselves must be configured with proper teardowns to run sequentially.

### test.name.skip.portal.instance

### test.portal.instance
This boolean determines whether portal test is running on portal instances

### test.poshi.warnings.file.name
